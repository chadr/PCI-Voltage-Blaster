# PCI Voltage Blaster
 PCI +3.3V version of the Voltage Blaster project. This is meant to power PCI cards keyed for +5V slots that still require +3.3V. Like the "new" Chinese made ATI Rage XL PCI cards found all over eBay.

 This mini version is good for about 500mA. It's not meant for high-powered PCI devices.

 NOTE: Most +5V only PCI motherboards don't route the +3.3V pins between slots. You will have to add bodge wires on the back of your motherboard between the slot with the Voltage Blaster and the slot that needs +3.3V.
